## üõ†Ô∏è Projects
### [Nutrisync](https://www.nutrisync.fit/)
This is a website made for the Software Engineering degree Capstone class where I worked in a team of 5. This website is a nutrition website aimed at helping users track food and make meal plans. It passed in my Capstone class with a perfect 100% grade. It is also fully accessible and mobile friendly!

- This is a private Github repo

#### Status 
- __Version 1 is complete__. 
- Fully functional, but lacking many nice to have features such as many foods, profile pictures, and more.


### [PlanWeave](https://planweave.com/)
This is a personal website that attempts to solve a problem I have, namely tracking and organizing tasks from anywhere even on the go. The goal is to have one set of tasks that have all the information, then several views to see the tasks in different contexts. For example, a calendar view to see scheduled tasks, or a linear todo view for the day to see what is up ahead of you.

- [Github repo](https://github.com/Nellak2017/plan-weave)

#### Status
- __Version 1 is incomplete__.
- Somewhat functional with the primary components made, but Critical UI bugs are known and being resolved.
- Significantly more complex UI and client state than Nutrisync, so hard to test and release.
